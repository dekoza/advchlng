# Welcome

## How to use:

1. `docker-compose build`
2. `docker-compose up`

As `swapi.co` is no longer alive, `swapi.dev` is used as replacement - configurable via settings.

TODO:

1. Use celery - fetching data should be a task
2. Use DRF to create REST API instead of html-based views. Maybe even use FastAPI instead of Django.
3. Add more tests
4. Better UI
5. There are some additional `TODO` tags within the code.

I'll gladly discuss any plans for extending this app.
